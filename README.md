## Local Setup:

To run this application, you will need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node JS</a> installed on your computer.

Once you have Node JS installed, open up your cmd prompt and navigate to the directory you would like to install this app. 

Then, run the following commands: 

           - git clone https://github.com/packleader206/memory-game-react.git ENTER
           
           - cd memory-game-react ENTER
           
           - npm install ENTER
           
 <strong>Once npm install is complete, the app is ready to run! Simply enter the command "npm start", to play the game.</strong>

## Instructions:

Users can start the game by clicking on any Superhero picture tile.  After each click, the Superhero tiles are shuffled.  Users score a point for each tile clicked that hasn't been clicked yet.  If the user clicks the same tile a second time before correctly getting them all, the game will start over and a message will notify the user of such.  The app will keep track of the user's highest score for each game session.
